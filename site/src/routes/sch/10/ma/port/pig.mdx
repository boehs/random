# Conditional Probability With Tree Diagrams

<Tree
  data={{
    name: "ðŸ˜ˆ v ðŸ‘¨",
    children: [
      {
        name: "Heads",
        children: [{ name: "Heads" }, { name: "Tails" }],
      },
      { name: "Tails" },
    ],
  }}
/>

The devil proposes a deal to Alex. Alex will flip a coin twice.

<dl>
  <dt>Heads, Heads</dt>
  <dd>Win 1000000$ <EmOMG giphy="fikiml0dKfRQ2ZS08E" /></dd>
  <dt>Heads, Tails</dt>
  <dd>Tie</dd>
  <dt>Tails</dt>
  <dd>Lose soul <EmOMG giphy="xGE1Nr8GE5Xag" /></dd>
</dl>

Alex is excited about the opportunity, but wants to know the chance of each outcome.

We can reason about this using tree diagrams. Each row represents a particular round. For instance, if Alex flips his coin twice, there will be two rows.

Each node represents an outcome. In this case, the nodes in the first row represent the two states of a coin &mdash; heads and tails. If it's heads, then we move onto the second row where there are another two outcomes: `Head, Head`; and `Head, Tails`.

<Tree
  data={{
    name: "ðŸ˜ˆ v ðŸ‘¨",
    children: [
      {
        name: "Heads",
        lc: "red",
        children: [{ name: "Heads - 25%", lc: "red" }, { name: "25%" }],
      },
      { name: "50%" },
    ],
  }}
/>

To get the chance for a particular outcome, you want to multiply the chances for all the rounds that lead to it together.

For instance, if Alex wants the chance of getting two heads, he would do <E>50\\%\\times50\\%</E>, because both tosses have a 50% chance of heads. He knows the chance of loosing his soul is <E>50\\%</E>, because the chance in the first round is <E>50\\%</E>, and if that happens no more rounds are conducted.

# Expected Value

Let's say you are offered a hat with a 10\$ bill, a 5\$ bill, and a 1\$ bill. You will draw from it twice, and you want to know the average amount of money you will get per draw, because Sir Hat <EmOMG giphy="xULW8gIuijhLhyODMk"/> charges 10\$ a game.

<Tree data={dat} />
You decide to represent the situation with a tree once again. The expected value
is the average value for the game

We can get the average in two ways. We can multiply each percentage by its possibility and add them together:

<E type="block">
  {r`(15\times\frac{1}{6})+(11\times\frac{1}{6})+...`}
</E>

Or, if each percentage is the same, we can factor it out.

<E type="block">
  {r`\frac{15+11+...}{6}`}
</E>

Both of these give us our <E>\text\{EV\}</E>. Each outcome is equal to <E>{r`\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{2}`}</E>, because there is a <E>{r`\frac{1}{3}`}</E> chance of each value in the first draw, and in the second draw, there is a <E>{r`\frac{1}{2}`}</E> chance because there is one less bill.

This means we can do the factoring method.

<E type="block">
  {(() => {
    const top = dat.children
      .flatMap((child) => {
        return child.children
          .map(
            (c) => `(${child.name.replace("$", "")}+${c.name.replace("$", "")})`
          )
          .join("+");
      })
      .join("+");
    return r`\frac{${top}}{${6}}=\frac{64}{6}=10.66\$`
  })()}
</E>

# Fair and balanced <EmOMG giphy="xT8qBit7YomT80d0M8"/>

A fair game is one where both parties have equal expected values. For instance, say Evan and Penny are spinning a wheel. The wheel has a 75% bias to Penny, but Evan only needs to pay her 1\$ when she wins. If the wheel lands on Evan's section, she needs to pay him 4\$. Who comes out ahead?

In this scenario, we will calculate the EV from either participant's perspective.

<E type="block">
  {r`EV_e=-1\frac{3}{4}+4\frac{1}{4}=0.25`}
</E>

This means the game is unfair â€” Evan has an EV of 0.25, and that makes penny a little sad. She wants to make it fair, so the equation needs to be *balanced*. That is â€” when added together, the equation should equal zero.

There are <E>\infty</E> solutions, but here is one:

<E type="block">
  {r`EV_e=-1\frac{3}{4}+\color{green}3\color{black}\frac{1}{4}=0`}
</E>

The probabilities could also be changed.
